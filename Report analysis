HONEYPOT INCIDENT REPORT
=========================

Incident Type : Brute Force Attack
Detection Mode: Honeypot Monitoring
Generated On  : Automated

----------------------------------
IP Address   : 127.0.0.1
Attempts     : 5
Attack Type  : Brute Force Attack
Severity     : HIGH
----------------------------------

Description:
Multiple failed authentication attempts were detected from the same IP
address within a short time window. This behavior matches brute-force
attack patterns.

Action Taken:
- Activity logged
- Attacker credentials captured
- Incident flagged as HIGH severity

Recommendation:
- Block IP if exposed to real environment
- Enable IDS/IPS correlation
- Use firewall rules for mitigation
How It Works:
1. Honeypot listens on a fake SSH port (2222)
2. Attacker connects (e.g., from Kali Linux)
3. Fake login banner is shown
4. Username & password are captured
5. Attempts are counted per IP
6. Severity is assigned automatically
7. Incident report & graph are generated

---

Testing (Kali Linux):
```bash
nc <WINDOWS_IP> 2222
Try multiple login attempts to simulate a brute-force attack.
Severity Logic:
Attempts
Severity
< 3
LOW
3–4
MEDIUM
≥ 5
HIGH
Output Example:
honeypot.log → raw attacker data
incident_report.txt → summarized security incident
traffic_graph.png → visual attack pattern
